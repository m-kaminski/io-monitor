# io-monitor

## Overview

This is a thin shim intended to be used with **LD_PRELOAD** in order
to capture/intercept many C library calls for the purpose of
getting real-time metrics without having to change any existing
source code. The idea is that relevant metrics should be
captured very efficiently and then handed off to another process
to handle.

## IPC Mechanism

The preferred IPC mechanism is **Unix SysV message queues**. In order
to make use of the captured metrics, you must set the environment
variable **MESSAGE_QUEUE_PATH** to an existing file where user has
permissions for writing.

## Identifying Metrics

Each captured metric has an **operation type** to identify the kind
of operation that generated the metric. In some cases, the specified
operation is a family of functions grouped by functionality.
For example, the 'OPEN' operation on files can be one of the
following functions: open, open64, creat, creat64, fopen, fopen64.

Every operation type belongs to a **domain**. The domain is simply
a grouping mechanism to treat a certain logically related set
of operations as one (e.g., to enable/disable monitoring).

## Environment Variables

| Variable           | Required? | Description |
| ------             | --------- | ----------- |
| FACILITY_ID        | N         | Identifies the component. defaults to 'u' |
| MESSAGE_QUEUE_PATH | Y         | File path of existing file associated with SysV message queue |
| MONITOR_DOMAINS    | Y         | list of comma-separated domains to monitor or 'ALL' |
| START_ON_OPEN      | N         | starts paused, resumes on open of specified file |
| START_ON_ELAPSED   | N         | starts paused, resumes on elapsed time crossing specified threshold |

## System requirements

This program should work on any Linux distribution. For build, in addition to standard
toolchain, you will need indent utility.

## START_ON_OPEN

START_ON_OPEN causes io monitor to start in paused mode. It will remain paused until a
file is opened whose path contains (substring) the value specified by this variable. 

In some cases, there may be a great deal of unwanted captures that occur when process
is first started. An example would be running a Python program. When the Python
interpreter starts it reads many files as part of its initialization.

The START_ON_OPEN feature can prevent such undesirable startup noise. If you set a
value for the environment variable 'START_ON_OPEN', the monitor will start in 'paused'
mode. It will remain paused until a file open operation occurs with the file path
containing the specified value. 

For example, you might set START_ON_OPEN as:

    export START_ON_OPEN="hello_world.txt"

for a Python program that begins by opening the file "hello_world.txt". This technique
would prevent the normal Python initialization traffic from being captured by the monitor.

## Metrics

| Metric            | Description |
| ------            | ----------- |
| facility          | identifier of component that generated the metrics |
| ts                | unix timestamp of when operation occurred |
| duration          | elapsed time of operation in milliseconds |
| pid               | process id where metrics were collected |
| domain            | domain grouping for the operation |
| op-type           | type of operation |
| error code        | integer error code. 0 = success; non-zero = errno in most cases |
| fd                | file descriptor associated with operation, or -1 if N/A |
| bytes transferred | number of bytes transferred for read/write operations |
| arg1              | context dependent |
| arg2              | context dependent |

## Running Listener

As io_monitor is a library collecting datapoints, default way to collect and display these datapoints is utility called mq_listener. To run mq_listener it is required to give it path to message queue file. It is also advisable to load at least one output plugin, as otherwise mq_listener won't tell you about events, it collects.

Assuming, you have your mq in root directory of this project, you can run mq_listener following way:

    ./mq_listener/mq_listener -m mq1 -p plugins/output_table.so

Alternatively you can use config file for following invocation:

    ./mq_listener/mq_listener -c mq_listener/listener.conf.example

There is possibility to load multiple plugins at once for following reasons:
- use plugins as UI
- use plugins as data filters (drop some events)
- use multiple forms of display or multiple forms of logging at once.

Consider following example:

    ./mq_listener/mq_listener -m mq1 -p plugins/filter_domain.so HTTP -p plugins/output_table.so

In this case only HTTP related events will be displayed even if MONITOR_DOMAINS variable is set to ALL. This is convenient way to change subset of monitored functions without restarting monitored application. Keep in mind that correct order of plugins is important.
